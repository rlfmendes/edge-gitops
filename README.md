# Retail Edge Onboarding Repo

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Onboarding

- Request a test fleet from the Platform Team (contact bartr)
- Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/cse-labs/moss) and join the `Microsoft`, `cse-labs` and `retaildevcrews` GitHub orgs
  - Validation repos
    - If you get a 403 or 404 error make sure you joined the orgs
    - <https://github.com/cse-labs/private-test>
    - <https://github.com/retaildevcrews/private-test>
- Go through the Kubernetes in Codespaces inner-loop hands-on lab
  - Repeat until you are comfortable with Codespaces, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Fluent Bit, Grafana, K9s, and our inner-loop process (everything builds on this)
- Go through the GitOps Automation [Quick Start](https://github.com/bartr/autogitops)

## Setup your GitHub PAT

> We use multiple GitHub Repos, so you have to use a PAT

- Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your GitHub account
  - Grant repo and package access
  - You can use an existing PAT as long as it has permissions
  - <https://github.com/settings/tokens>

- Grant SSO access to the token
  - cse-labs
  - retaildevcrews
  - Any other tenant you choose

- Create a personal Codespace secret
  - <https://github.com/settings/codespaces>
  - Name: PAT
  - Value: your PAT
  - Grant access to this repo and any other repos you want

## Create a Codespace

> Create your Codespace from the main branch

- Click on `Code` then click `New Codespace`

Once Codespaces is running:

> Make sure your terminal is running zsh - bash is not supported and will not work
>
> If it's running bash, exit and create a new terminal (this is a random bug in Codespaces)

## Test Fleet

- Request a test fleet from the Platform Team (contact bartr, anflinch or kevinshah)
- Once your fleet is created, the Platform Team will provide the branch name
- Do all of your work in this branch
- Do not PR your branch to main
- Do not use other branches
  - These branches are used for customer demos
  - Some CLI commands can change behavior

### Checkout your branch

  ```bash

  # you should already be in this directory
  cd /workspaces/edge-gitops
  git pull
  git checkout yourBranchName
  git pull

  ```

## Check your Fleet

> flt is the fleet CLI provided by Retail Edge / Pilot-in-a-Box

```bash

# list clusters in the fleet
flt list

# check heartbeat on the fleet
# you should get 17 bytes from each cluster
# if not, please reach out to the Platform Team for support
flt check heartbeat

# update the fleet
# (run twice if there are updates so you can see it's clean)
flt pull

```

> Note that the create, delete, and groups commands will not work unless you have been granted additional access

## Deploy the Reference App

- IMDb is the reference app

### If you get a 403 error from `flt targets deploy`, your PAT isn't setup correctly

```bash

cd apps/imdb

# check deploy targets (should be [])
flt targets list

# clear the targets if not []
flt targets clear

# add the central region as a target
flt targets add region:central

# deploy the changes
flt targets deploy

```

## Check that your GitHub Action is running

- <https://github.com/retaildevcrews/edge-gitops/actions>
  - your action should be queued or in-progress

## Action not running

- If your action is not running within 10-15 seconds
- Verify that your PAT has sufficient permissions

### Make sure your PAT has the correct permissions and is authorized for SSO in the orgs

  ```bash

  # try pushing manually
  git push

  ```

## Check deployment

- Once the action completes successfully

```bash

# force flux to sync
flt sync

# check that imdb is deployed to central
flt check app imdb

```

## Create and Deploy a New App

- Create a TestApp from the dotnet WebAPI template
  - Deploy and test in inner-loop
  - Deploy and test on the fleet

```bash

# start in the apps directory
cd /workspaces/edge-gitops/apps
git pull

# make sure git is "clean"
#  commit / push as needed
git status

# create a new dotnet WebAPI app
# you can use any app name as long as it is PascalCaseAlpha
# if you use a different app name, you will have to make the docker image public (bug)
#   you have to be an owner of github/retaildevcrews to do this
#   or change ci-cd / autogitops.json to point to a ghcr that you control
# if in doubt, use TestApp or MyApp
flt new dotnet webapi TestApp

# change to the testapp directory
cd testapp

```

## Deploy to the fleet

> Start in apps/testapp dir

```bash

# set the target to west region and deploy via GitOps
flt targets clear
flt targets add region:west
flt targets deploy

# wait for ci-cd to finish

# check for the new namespace
flt sync
flt check app testapp

# undeploy testapp
git pull
flt targets clear
flt targets deploy

# wait for ci-cd to finish
flt sync

# it will take a few seconds for the ns to be deleted
flt check app testapp

```

## inner-loop

> Start in apps/testapp dir

- Remove apps if necessary

  ```bash

  # check the pods
  kic pods

  # if any pods are running app, monitoring, or logging recreate the cluster
  kic cluster create

  ```

- Build and deploy TestApp

> Start in apps/testapp dir

  ```bash

  git pull

  # build test app
  kic app build

  # rebuild cluster and deploy testapp + webv
  kic app deploy

  # wait for pods to start
  kic pods

  # check the app
  kic check app

  # check all
  kic check all

  # run tests
  kic test load &
  kic test integration

  ```

## Clean up

```bash

# start in the apps directory
cd /workspaces/edge-gitops/apps

# remove test app
git pull
rm -rf testapp
git commit -am "removed testapp"
git push

# your repo should be "clean"

# re-create the cluster
kic cluster create

```

## Observability

> More instructions coming soon

- Retail Edge provides logs, metrics, and dashboards out of the box
- The setup is currently "semi-automated"
  - Send a request to the Platform Team to setup your observability stack

## Customizing the CLI

> More instructions coming soon

- `flt` and `kic` can be customized / extended
  - often without changing the Go code
